# 🧠 DeepSign — Learn American Sign Language with AI

**DeepSign** is an interactive web app that helps users learn American Sign Language (ASL) using deep learning and computer vision. The project allows users to practice signs in front of their webcam and includes a blind quiz mode to test their knowledge.

This repository contains the **frontend** of the project, which serves the ASL model via an API and provides a user-friendly interface for learning and practicing. 

This project is part of the Le Wagon's Data Science bootcamp.
